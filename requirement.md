Project Name: CentaShield
Objective: A robust security and monitoring solution for web environments.
​Functional Requirements
​Real-time Monitoring: The system must track incoming web traffic and identify potential threats or anomalies.
​Automated Threat Mitigation: Capability to block or flag suspicious IP addresses or user agents based on predefined security rules.
​User Dashboard: A central interface for administrators to view security logs, active threats, and system health.
​Alerting System: Instant notifications via email or webhooks when a high-severity security breach is detected.
​Non-Functional Requirements
​Scalability: The architecture should handle high-traffic volumes without significant latency.
​Security: The tool itself must follow best practices for secure coding to prevent it from being an entry point for attackers.
​Reliability: High availability (99.9% uptime) to ensure continuous protection.
